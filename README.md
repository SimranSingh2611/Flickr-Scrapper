# Flickr-Scrapper
In this project, I did: 
1. Data Collection: Scraped data from Flickr for creating a social network. The chosen website for scraping had to be a social network, where each node represents a user and each edge is a friendship or follower-followee relationship. The nodes and edges were crawled from the source website, not created by me. 
2. Created a social network with a Graph package Networkx and visualized the Graph.
3. Calculated network measures: Degree Distribution, Clustering Coefficient, Pagerank, Diameter, Closeness.
